      "I’m Pietro Putelli, I’m a creative and young person, who loves to share and discuss several topics with others and always learn new things.\n\nI love reading about everything but also spending hours developing new ideas, as I think coding is the best way to express my creativity.\n\nSince I’m way into design and marketing aspects of a product, for the past year I've been working on a personal project, named Real that has been a great challenge for me from the tech and product point of view.\n\nCurrently I'm looking for a job opportunity as fullstack junior developer since I'd really like to work in a team to improve my skills and start my professional career.\n\nSo if you’d like to talk or share some feedbacks about my work, let’s get in touch.",
