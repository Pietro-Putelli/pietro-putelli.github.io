            Hi, my name is Pietro Putelli, I am 20 years old and I live in
            Italy. I attended scientific high school and then I enrolled in the
            first year of the University of computer science. Since Iâ€™m a
            creative and ambitious person, passionate about the design and
            functionality of products, I decided to develop a project and create
            a business model with the purpose of founding a startup. Therefore a
            means for expressing my creativity, for the past four years, I
            studied various programming languages, design psychology and
            marketing strategies.
